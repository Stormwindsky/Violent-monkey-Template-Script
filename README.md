# Violent Monkey Template Script 🐵

This is a CC0 1.0 licensed script for Violent Monkey that I created, which only modifies the Example.com web page.

<div align="center"> <img title="Showcase" alt="Showcase" src="Example.png"> </div>


This template is not affiliated with Team ViolentMonkey & with Example.com. It was created by Stormwindsky, who is not affiliated with the team.

If you want to test the script, here is the extension to download. Please note that I know there are alternatives similar to Violent Monkey, but I have never really tested them, so I cannot guarantee that they will work.
